## A Ghost like Markdown Editor replacement for Wordpress

### How to install

2. You need to run ```git submodule init``` and ```git submodule update``` to pull showdown.js

### Note:
This plugin is ***lacking some features*** like the Media Manager Integration and so on. I'm working on this, but it can take some time.
